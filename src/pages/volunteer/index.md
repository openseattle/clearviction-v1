    title: What We Do
    description: We are reducing barriers faced by formerly incarcerated individuals by streamlining process of vacating eligible convictions in Washington state. We analyzed the process of conviction vacation in Washington state, and have identified opportunities to use technology to streamline the process. Our efforts at the National Day of Civic Hacking on September 21st focused on automating eligibility calculation for conviction vacation. We see future opportunity to streamline the completion of the required forms. We are investigating the feasibility of a Turbo Tax style interface to simplify this process, and then e-filing the forms in counties where it is permitted.
  impact:
    title: What is the social impact of CVP, where does this project fit into larger context?
    description: While the need for social justice is not news to anyone, the many forms injustice and excessive punishment comes in can be surprising!  While there are already countless organizations chipping away at some aspects … we’ve found those previously convicted of crimes …. Unsympathetic community relegated to life-long millstone… over and above the punition meted out by the courts…
  groupDynamic:
    title: What is the volunteer group like, socially/professionally?
    description: We’re quite a diverse crew, drawn together by a drive for social justice and a love for Zoom meetings. In addition to doing the real work of CVP, we spend time getting to know each other, working to establish esprit de corps despite our distance.
  qualifications:
    title: What kinds of expertise, experience or knowledge should I have in order to contribute?
    description: Having some experience in a software development role like UX, dev, content manager, product manager, or designer is pretty handy. That said, we are constantly learning things from each other, so you can also try your hand at disciplines newer to you.
  timeExpectations:
    title: Do time commitment expectations of project align with mine?
    description: The way we engage is more regular than one might swoop in, knock out some tickets, and swoop out. We engage regularly, not just through our respective skill-sets, but with the team and project as a whole! This commitment amounts to, on average, about three hours every week for at least six months.
  status:
    title: Is this project in active development and what can I expect to work on?
    description: Like any iterative, agile development process, nothing is ever quite done! There’s plenty of work to be done by anyone with a skill-set useful in a modern software development life cycle!
  contact:
    title: How do I get started?
    description: After reaching out to us, you and Seamus will have a Zoom chat about yourself, the project, and how the two could fit together! There’s a relatively painless, self-guided onboarding process, and then we’ll loop you into our overarching project activities while you decide which of the smaller, more focused sub-groups to join.
